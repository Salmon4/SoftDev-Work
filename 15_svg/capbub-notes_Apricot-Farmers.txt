v1:
From the code, I can see that there is a table in index.html. There is an
Eventlistener in the JavaScript that will activate upon click for each item in
the table. I predict that upon clicking, a message/alert will pop up with the
text that is contained inside the clicked table. I assumed innerHTML to be the
text and when I checked it out, my predictions were true. I notice that the
<tr> tag is used to indicate a row while <td> is each item.

v2:
The second code contained some similarity with the first. There should still be
the alert from clicking on a cell but there is another Eventlistener which
should show an alert when a row is clicked. I think when the row is clicked, the
entire content of that row will be shown. There is an Eventlistener for the
table itself which should show everything. I think the cell will alert first,
then the row, and lastly the table. My predictions were true and I noticed how
the alerts for rows and the table contained the tags. Clicking on the border
only shows the alert for the table.
